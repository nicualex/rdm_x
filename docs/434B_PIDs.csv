- Serial number list (packed, no delimiters, big endian) (variable length)
NACK responses are as follows:
- 0x0004: Device not in bootloader mode
- 0x0006: PDS serial number list size <1 or >255, or packet SN count <1 or >38
- 0x0009: Serial number in list not known to PDS, or SFT versions do not match
The ACK response contains the total number of serial numbers in the list"
SET_COMMAND (0x30),F003,Set Boot Image Info,32 bytes,"Includes:
- Image size in bytes (8 bytes)
- Image CRC (8 bytes) [CRC-16 CCITT is the algorithm used]
- Image version (8 bytes)
- SFT number (8 bytes)
NACK responses are as follows:
- 0x0001: payload size is not 4 bytes
- 0x0004: device not in bootloader mode
- 0x0006: SFT mismatch, image too large, or other problem with the payload
ACK responses contain the size of the flash block in bytes (2 bytes)"
SET_COMMAND (0x30),F004,Set Boot Image file,Variable,"Sets a single flash block fragment of the boot image.  Format is as follows:
- Packet sequence number (2 bytes)
- Payload byte count (1 byte)
- Payload (variable up to 228 bytes)
ACK response format is as follows
- Packet sequenct number (2 bytes)
- Hold time until next packet (milliseconds) (4 bytes)
NACK responses are as follows:
- 0x0001: CRC failure
- 0x0002: Write failure
- 0x0004: Device not ready to receive image data
- 0x0006: Packet out of sequence, SFT mismatch, or data size incorrect"
SET_COMMAND (0x30),F006,Initiate FW update,None,"Instructs PDS to begin the bootloading process.  For PDS updates, this validates the image and sets the boot target.  For subdevice updates, this validates the image and begins bootloading the subdevices in the target list.
NACK responses are as follows:
- 0x0002: Failed to initiate bootloading process"
GET_COMMAND (0x20),F007,Get bootload status,11 bytes,"Returns the status of the current bootloading operation.  Response format is as follows:
- Serial nmber list size (1 byte)
- Current serial number list index (1 byte)
- Serial number (8 byte)
- Status code for current serial number (1 byte):
-- 0x00: Not done
-- 0x01: In progress
-- 0x02: Done
-- 0x03: CRC mismatch
-- 0x04: Failed Flash
-- 0x05: SFT mismatch
-- 0x06: UU file header parse error
-- 0x07: Authenticate error
-- 0x08: Decryption error
-- 0x09 – 0xFF: reserved"
SET_COMMAND (0x30),F008,Set PDS bootloader entry,Magic value of 0x424F4F54 (ASCII for BOOT),Places PDS into bootloader mode and returns encryption parameters.  SET commands which lack the proper magic value are responded with NACK:NR_UNKNOWN_PID
SET_COMMAND (0x30),F009,Abort bootload process,None,"Aborts the bootload process.  ACK responses contain a single byte status code as follows:
- 0x00: Abort unsuccessful
- 0x01: Abort will occur after current subdevice completes
- 0x02: Abort successful"
